# RAG
This is a PDF RAG deployed with [streamlit](https://demo-pdf-rag.streamlit.app/), with the script starting at bot.py. This was adapted from the streamlit tutorial by Neo4j [here](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-chatbot-python/). While all files except the ipynb are relevant to streamlit.

The ipynb is an independent notebook that follows the Neo4j-LLM course [here](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-fundamentals/), which gives an overview of RAG, LangChain and using Neo4j as the vector store.
